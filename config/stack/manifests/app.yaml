# Markdown description of this entry
readme: |
 This `provider-rook` repository is a Crossplane infrastructure provider for [Rook](https://rook.io/).
 The provider that is built from the source code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the following new functionality:

 * Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model Rook infrastructure and services (e.g. [Yugabyte](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db), [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach), etc.)
 * Controllers to provision these resources in a Rook Kubernetes cluster based on the users desired state captured in CRDs they create
 * Implementations of Crossplane's [portable resource abstractions](https://crossplane.io/docs/master/concepts.html), enabling Rook resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services
