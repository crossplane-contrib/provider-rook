title: Crossplane Rook

overviewShort: The GCP Crossplane Stack enabling resource management for Rook.
overview: |-
  The Rook Crossplane Stack adds support for managing Rook resources from a Crossplane Kubernetes cluster.

  YugabyteDB and CockroachDB cluster resources can be provisioned, updated, and deleted by this stack.

# Markdown description of this entry
readme: |
This `stack-rook` repository is the implementation of a Crossplane infrastructure
[stack](https://github.com/crossplaneio/crossplane/blob/master/design/design-doc-stacks.md) for
[Rook](https://rook.io/).
 The stack that is built from the source code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the following new functionality:

 * Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model Rook infrastructure and services (e.g. [Yugabyte](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db), [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach), etc.)
 * Controllers to provision these resources in a Rook Kubernetes cluster based on the users desired state captured in CRDs they create
 * Implementations of Crossplane's [portable resource abstractions](https://crossplane.io/docs/master/running-resources.html), enabling Rook resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services
