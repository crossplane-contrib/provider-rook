title: Crossplane GCP

overviewShort: The GCP Crossplane Stack enabling resource management for the Google Cloud Platform.
overview: |-
  The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Crossplane Stack adds support for managing GCP resources in Kubernetes.

  Google Kubernetes Engine, Google Cloud SQL, Google Cloud Memorystore, and Google Cloud Storage resources can be provisioned, updated, and deleted by this stack.

# Markdown description of this entry
readme: |
 This `stack-gcp` repository is the implementation of a Crossplane infrastructure
 [stack](https://github.com/crossplaneio/crossplane/blob/master/design/design-doc-stacks.md) for
 [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).
 The stack that is built from the source code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the following new functionality:

 * Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model GCP infrastructure and services (e.g. [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/), [GKE clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/), etc.)
 * Controllers to provision these resources in GCP based on the users desired state captured in CRDs they create
 * Implementations of Crossplane's [portable resource abstractions](https://crossplane.io/docs/master/running-resources.html), enabling GCP resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services
